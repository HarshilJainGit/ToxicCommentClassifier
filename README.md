Comment Classifier: A multi-label classification problem
Gaurav Jain, Harshil Jain



Websites like Wikipedia, Quora, Reddit etc. have become a great platform for users to share or exchange knowledge through effective communication. While the user is free to share content as per their desire, it is the need of the hour to maintain decorum on public forums. With the increase in the number of such public forums, the threat of abuse and cyber-bullying is increasing. The reputation of such public forums are on the line when they have such toxic comments on their page. Thus it is imperative for such forums to identify toxic comments and posts and not allow them to be displayed on their site. However, just identifying whether a comment is toxic or not is not enough, it is necessary to classify the comments into multiple labels like toxic, severely toxic, identity hate, abuse, threat and insult. Thus we performed a comparative study of some common classification models and some complex models like Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory Networks. The performance of these models were compared under different set of features and hyper parameters for tuning of the models.
